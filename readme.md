## Paper Structure

A paper is organised into questions, everything belongs to a question - question text, figures, subquestions etc.

### Question Numbers

Elements in an item number is point seperated. A question's number is position based, so dragging a question up will move it around in the paper, and will change its number accordingly

Examply References:

- `Question 1` Question 1
- `Question 1.1` Question 1 Part 1
- `Figure 1.a` Question 1 Figure A
- `Figure 3.12.7.b` Question 3 Part 12 Part 7 Figure B

#### Question

Refs ending in a number refer to a question, questions can be subquestions / parts of other questions

#### Figures

Refs ending in a letter refer to a figure - a piece of text or an image that is relevant / vital to the question.
